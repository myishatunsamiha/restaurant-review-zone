# Restaurant Review Zone - The Express Inn

## [https://restaurantreviewzone.netlify.app](https://restaurantreviewzone.netlify.app)

#### What I have done in the projects: 
* There are 5 tabs on the navigation bar (home, reviews, blogs, dashboard, about)
* The basic purpose of this website is to show the reviews of the customers and the business growth analysis of the restaurant using four charts
* On the home page, you can see a small view of the restaurant and few words about the place. You can see 3 randomly selected customers' reviews on the home page. 
* You can reach the reviews page from the navigation bar or by clicking the show all reviews at the bottom of the home page. On the reviews page, you can see all the customers' reviews.
* Each review is containing the customer's name who posted the review, the customer's image, the detailed review and the rating given by the customer.
* On the dash board page, you can see four charts. The line chart is analyzing the sell information for each month. The area, bar and pie charts are showing comparative analysis between investment and revenue each month.
* On the blogs page, three frequently asked questions have been answered.
* On the about page, you can see popular meals of the express inn restaurant. By clicking the explore button on each meal, you can see the details about the meal.
